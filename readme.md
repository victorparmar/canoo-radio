# Canoo Radio

Canoo Radio is a radio station based on `mpd` where listeners decide upon and vote on its content. It is a full fledged web application that comes with a `Node.js` server and an `Angular.js` front-end. Canoo radio also depends upon `mpd` to manage the song library + the playlist and `Icecast` to allow the output of mpd to be fed to an http audio streamng endpoint.

At the moment the entire development stack is setup on Linux with instructions provided here for installing mpd and icecast on debian based systems. Mac and windows users will need to figure out how to get mpd and icecast setup as the installation is different from that of linux. One option is to install mpd and icecast on a separate ubuntu machine and connect to the mpd server on it.

## Setup

### Installing icecast on linux

Install icecast via `sudo apt-get install icecast2`.

You can provide the hostname for icecast while installing or leave as localhost if you only plan on having your radio station accessible over the internal network. Make sure to change the password to something better than the default `hackme`.

The icecast configuration can be found here: `/etc/icecast2/icecast.xml`. Change the port to `4710` and configure the mount to be `/stream`.

```
    <authentication>
        <source-password><PASSWORD OF ICECAST></source-password>
        <relay-password><PASSWORD OF ICECAST></relay-password>
        <admin-user>admin</admin-user>
        <admin-password><PASSWORD OF ICECAST></admin-password>
    </authentication>
    <listen-socket>
        <port><PORT OF ICECAST></port>
        <shoutcast-mount><MOUNT OF ICECAST></shoutcast-mount>
    </listen-socket>
```

### Installing mpd on linux

`sudo apt-get install mpd`. Configure mpd in `/etc/mpd.conf`

```
bind_to_address "::"

    audio_output {
     type            "shout"
     name            "Canoo Radio shoutcast"
     host            "localhost"
     port            "<PORT OF ICECAST>"
     mount           "<MOUNT OF ICECAST>"
     password        "<PASSWORD OF ICECAST>"
     bitrate         "128"
     format          "44100:16:2"
     encoding        "mp3"
   }
   audio_output {
          type "pulse"
          name "Canoo Radio RDP"
          sink "rtp"
   }
```

Fix mpd ownership `sudo chown -R mpd /var/lib/mpd/music`

### Setup verification

Check that the services are running:

```
sudo service mpd status
sudo service icecast2 status
```

Note that mpd is listening on `6600` and icecast is listening on `4710` in the current setup.

At this point you can also install Sonata via `sudo apt-get install sonata`, which is a gui to manage mpd. You should run sonata and make sure that you can connect to and play songs via mpd. To add music to the library you can simply copy a few mp3 files over to the `/var/lib/mp3/music` folder and make sure to set the ownership of all files within this folder to mpd: `sudo chown -R mpd:audio /var/lib/mpd/music`. Make sure to refresh the music directory in sonata to get mpd to update it's database.

If you have something playing via mpd, you can also verify that the icecast stream is working correctly by typing the following into your browser: `http://localhost:4710/stream`.

Once you have verified that everything is setup correctly, you can proceed with setting up the project :)

## Project

Install global dependencies:

```
sudo npm install -g browserify
sudo npm install -g clean-css
sudo npm install -g uglifyjs
sudo npm install -g nodemon
sudo npm install -g envify
sudo npm install -g node-sass
sudo npm install -g mocha
sudo npm install -g forever
```

Install project dependencies via `npm install`.

### running

```
npm run build-js
npm run build-sass
```

This will dist the combined `app.js` under the `public/dist/` folder and the `canooradio.css` to the dist folder as well. You might need to create the `dist` folder as it is not checked in.

`npm run all` will run in development mode where changes to the `js` folder and the `sass` folder are watched via nodemon.

```
node radio.js
```

to run the app. However in production you probably want to run node using a process manager like `forever`.

```
forever list
forever stop radio.js
forever start radio.js

```

### Testing

```
env ENV=test mocha test/test-mpd.js
env ENV=test mocha test/test-radio.js
env ENV=test mocha test/test-db-wrapper.js
mocha test/test-mpd-integration.js
```

to run tests located under the `tests` folder. Note that the `test` environment uses mock mpd data and if you'd like to test with the mpd service running then exclude the environment variable but then the expectations on tests will likely not pass :)

Note that the tests need to be run individually due to the file-based db
